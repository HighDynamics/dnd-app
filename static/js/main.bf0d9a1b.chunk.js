The colors within seem to leak out, like paint. Nolzur of Radigast City became a famed illusionist and alchemist as a member of the Company of Seven, but his legacy is often overshadowed by those of his compatriots. Nolzur and Keoghtom fell out more than a century ago, as the latter reputedly borrowed one of Nolzur's formulas to aid in his creation of the celebrated ointment that bears his name. Nolzur has yet to forgive him and his reclusion has caused his fame to fade over time. Few know that he began life as a thief or that his early travels took him far and wide, including to Blackmoor and the Pirate Isles of the Densac Gulf. He is most famous for the magical pigments that he developed, but he has numerous creations to his name, including this silvery sphere.\nNolzur's orb continually seeps oily paints that act as Nolzur's marvelous pigments 1/day. The paints issuing from the orb may also be used in creating elaborate guises, granting you a +10 competence bonus on all Disguise checks for up to 30 minutes, so long as the paints remain dry. Finally, you can fling the paints 1/day to create a prismatic spray with a range of 60 feet. If the paints are stored in any other device or container they lose all properties except those normally bestowed by Nolzur's marvelous pigments.\nstrong; (DC 22) conjuration and illusion CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self, major creation, prismatic spray. 30,200 gp, 2,416 XP.

The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.\n\nYou may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell.

For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant\u2019s level, provided that the spell\u2019s target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants\u2019 spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants\u2019 spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding spells are dismissible.\n\nRegardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature\u2019s name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don\u2019t qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.\n\nIf you are casting any of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell\u2019s duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the binding spells it has received are broken.\n\nThe binding spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.\n\nChaining\nThe subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.\n\nSlumber\nThis version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell\u2019s save DC by 1.\n\nBound Slumber\nThis combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.\n\nHedged Prison\nThe subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.\n\nMetamorphosis\nThe subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.\n\nMinimus Containment\nThe subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.\n\nYou can\u2019t dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or Mage\u2019s disjunction affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect.\n\nComponents\nThe components for a binding spell vary according to the version of the spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of binding used. These components can include such items as miniature chains of special metals, soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for slumber bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like\n\nIn addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of binding (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured."},{id:"srd51",name:"Black Tentacles",school:"Conjuration",subSchool:"Creation",level:"Sor/Wiz 4",components:"V, S, M",castingTime:"1 standard action",range:"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)",area:"20-ft.-radius spread",duration:"1 round/level (D)",savingThrow:"None",spellResistance:"No",description:"This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 10 feet long.
